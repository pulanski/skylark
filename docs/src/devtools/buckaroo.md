# Buckaroo (currently in development)

Buckaroo is a comprehensive tool for formatting Starlark code, performing static analysis, and linting, similar to tools like `rustfmt`, `clippy`, `rust-analyzer`, `clang-format`, and `clang-tidy`. It leverages the functionality provided by `sky_lexer`, `sky_parser`, and `sky_analyzer` to ensure consistent code quality and style across your project.

Once development is complete, more details on how Buckaroo works and how to use it in your project will be available in the API documentation.
