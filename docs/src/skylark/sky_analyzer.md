# `sky_analyzer` (currently in development)

The static analysis tool, `sky_analyzer`, is designed to analyze Starlark code incrementally at build time. It detects potential issues, such as type errors, unused variables, and other common mistakes, by examining the AST generated by the parser.

The analyzer can be integrated into your build process to provide real-time feedback on code quality, reducing the risk of introducing errors and helping to maintain a consistent codebase.

Once development is complete, more details on how the analyzer works and how to use it in your project will be available in the API documentation.
