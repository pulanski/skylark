# `sky_interpreter` (currently in development)

The runtime interpreter, `sky_interpreter`, is designed to execute Starlark code directly from the AST generated by the parser. It provides a fast, efficient, and flexible way to run Starlark scripts, making it ideal for embedding in other applications or using as a standalone interpreter.

Once development is complete, more details on how the interpreter works and how to use it in your project will be available in the API documentation.
