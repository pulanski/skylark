# `sky_lexer`

The lexical analysis module is responsible for breaking down source code into tokens, the basic building blocks for the parsing process. This stage of processing reads the input as a stream of characters and groups them into meaningful units, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and punctuation marks. The lexer also handles comments and whitespace, discarding them as needed to streamline the subsequent parsing process.

The lexer is designed with performance and error handling in mind, providing informative error messages and location information for easy debugging and integration with other tools.

For more details on how the lexer works and how to use it in your project, refer to the API documentation.
